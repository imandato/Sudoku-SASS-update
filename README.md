# Sudoku-Game

## Description

A game application that allows you to play 3 different levels of Sudoku (small, medium, hard). Sudoku is a logic based number placement game where a 9x9 grid is filled so that each column, row, and subgrid contain numbers 1-9.

## Demo

Currently, to deploy this game you must have the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey on VS Code. Once downloaded, you can click live server. 

## Technical Information

To edit this game follow the below instructions after forking and cloning:
- npm init -y
- npm install sass

## Issues

Currently throws an error when trying to deploy using nodemon.  Working on solving this.  I would also like to make the game auto-populate numbers instead of having set/pre-populated game boards.
